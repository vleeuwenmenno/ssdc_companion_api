# Privacy Policy & Terms of Use for Diffu App

## 1. Introduction

Menno Cornelis van Leeuwen ("I", "We", "Our" or "Us") has developed the Diffu app, a tool that enables users to generate images such as wallpapers, art, and portraits using Stable Diffusion provided by AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI as an API provider on the user's own PC. 

This document describes our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, setting out how we handle the information we have access to during the operation of the Diffu app and the rules for using our app.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

2.1. By using the Diffu app, you agree to these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you should not use the Diffu app.

## 3. Data We Collect

3.1. The Diffu app does not collect or transmit any personal data from your device (With the exception mentioned in section 7.) to us or any third-party service. Any data that is logged in the app, including detailed information about the tools used to generate the art and the timing and method of generation, stays on your device and is never stored or sent elsewhere.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

4.1. All data generated and logged by the Diffu app are stored only on your device. The data remains in your device's memory and is not transmitted off of your device unless you decide to do so. We do not store or have access to this data.

4.2. If you choose to use the optional OpenAI ChatGPT API feature, your API key and settings are stored on your device and are encrypted in your keychain. However, you are solely responsible for the security of your API key and any data associated with it. We cannot be held liable for any loss or exposure of your API key. (See section 7.)

## 5. Data Usage

5.1. The logged data inside the app is used solely for the purpose of enhancing the functionality of the app. This data is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with any third parties.

## 6. User Responsibilities

6.1. As a user, you are solely responsible for the content you generate with the Diffu app. You must ensure that the content you create is legal, ethical, and respectful, in accordance with your local laws and regulations. Misuse of the app to create unethical or illegal content, including but not limited to pornography or other offensive material, is strongly discouraged. We cannot monitor or control the content generated by users and thus cannot enforce these guidelines. By using the app, you acknowledge that any legal liability arising from such misuse rests solely with you.

## 7. OpenAI ChatGPT API

7.1. The app optionally allows users to specify an API key for OpenAI's ChatGPT API. If you choose to enable this feature, we strongly advise you to read and understand the privacy policy and terms of use of OpenAI.

7.2. We are not responsible or liable for any interaction or data transmission between you and OpenAI. Please exercise due caution when using this feature, keeping in mind the responsibilities outlined in section 6.

7.3. Be aware that use of the OpenAI's ChatGPT API may involve costs. You are solely responsible for any costs incurred as a result of enabling and using this feature. Please ensure you have full knowledge of any potential charges before enabling the API.

## 8. Disclaimer

8.1. We are not responsible for the content that the user prompts, generates, and so on using the Diffu app. The generation of the content depends on the user and the software provided for free by AUTOMATIC1111, over which we have no control.

## 9. Rights of European Union and French Users

9.1. If you are a resident of the European Union (EU) or France, you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the French Data Protection Act (FDPA) respectively.
